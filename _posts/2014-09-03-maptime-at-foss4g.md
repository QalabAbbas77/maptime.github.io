[FOSS4G](http://2014.foss4g.com) is just a week away, and we at MaptimeHQ are gearing up! We’re extremely excited for the conference, not least of all due to the massive amount of participation from Maptimers around the world. (And perhaps the births of a few new chapters?) Here’s a list of everything we have going on at FOSS4G:

Should be a ton of fun!
