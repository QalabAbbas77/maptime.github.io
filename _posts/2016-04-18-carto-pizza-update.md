<strong>Pizza Time!</strong><br>

Looking back at a long year of Maptimes and mapping fun, one thing has remained true: Pizza and mapping go hand-in-hand. CartoDB's Maptime pizza donations this past year has ensured that this remains true, and that mappers everywhere, from Chicago to Berlin, didn't go a mapping evening un-fed.

Over the course of the past year, over <strong>70 meetups</strong> across the world ate over <strong>2,500 slices</strong> of delicious cheesy pie asa  result of this collaboration, and CartoDB has announced they are <strong>extending their donation for another whole year!</strong> This means that every Maptime everywhere can enjoy delicious pizza courtesy of CartoDB well into 2017. now that's reason to celebrate!

##How does it work?
Same as before, getting pizza for your Maptime meetup is super easy. <strong>One week before every meetup</strong>, email <santiago@cartodb.com> with basic information about your event. Here's what to include:

* Maptime chapter
* Meetup date
* Meetup link
* Organizer's name & email
* Any interesting developments in your mapping community

And thats it! CartoDB will follow up with simple information on how to submit for pizza pay-back. In addition, if the pizza fuels some great CartoDB projects, inspires beautiful friendships, or if you just want to say thanks, be sure to tweet them @cartoDB.

Enjoy!
