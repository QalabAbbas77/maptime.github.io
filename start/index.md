## Start a Chapter!

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDbaUPjWoAAc1C8.jpg)

Ready to start a Maptime chapter for your city? There's not much to it. Most chapters have claimed a name that represents their city or region. You'll want to pick something that identifies your chapter without getting confused with other chapters around the world (e.g. MaptimeAthens can be Ohio, Georgia, or Greece). Once you're settled on your name, you may want to start a Twitter account for announcing your next meetup or gathering. Most chapters use Eventbrite, Meetup, or Splashthat to manage meetups. Once you're settled, let us know so we can list your chapter on our Chapters page by filling out [this form](#start-form). We'll just need a few details about your chapter:

- __Name.__ The name of the your primary contact.
- __Email.__ Optional but this good to have if we need to contact you.
- __Location.__ This gets added to the [map](http://maptime.io/chapters/).
- __Maptime Name.__ How do you wish to list your maptime chapter? Example: _MaptimeDC_, _MaptimePDX_, _MaptimeRoma_. Note other cities may have a similar name so use something that represents your city and avoids conflict with other similar names.

If there are any issues, we'll contact you for clarifications. If you still have questions, send us an email to [hello@maptime.io](mailto:hello@maptime.io)
